The ability to automatically identify objects is a vital task for
autonomous driving. In addition to requiring high accuracy
(like humans), object detection for autonomous driving also
requires very short computation time. This ensures the vehicle
can promptly react in a split second to keep passengers
and pedestrians safe. Deep learning models must be trained
on large datasets of 2D images and 3D data to improve the
accuracy of object detection and compute time. Even with
large datasets, autonomous vehicles are not ready for commercial
use and researchers are still improving on their deep
learning models. It could take years until the models are
fully mature to be used on public roads.
